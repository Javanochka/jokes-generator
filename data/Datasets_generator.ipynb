Fearful that she might lose her life as a painter, she went to see the best eye surgeon in the world. After several weeks of delicate surgery and therapy, her eyesight was restored. The painter was so grateful that she decided to show her gratitude by repainting the doctor's office. Part of her work included painting a gigantic eye on one wall. When she had finished her work, she held a press conference to unveil her latest work of art: the doctor's office. During the press conference, one reporter noticed the eye on the wall, and asked the doctor, \"What was your first reaction upon seeing your newly painted office, especially that large eye on the wall?\" To this, the eye doctor responded, \"I said to myself 'Thank God I'm not a gynecologist.'\"\n",

Not that you could ever see those bastards, mind you. They were fast and they knew their way around the jungle. He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.

The priest says \"I draw a circle, stand in the middle and throw everything up in the air. Whatever lands in the circle god has chosen for me to keep and everything outside goes to charitable work and expenses. \" The monk was fascinated and says \"I do the same thing. Only difference is I keep everything that goes outside of the circle and use what's in the circle for the church.\" The rabbi is taken back. \"You know what?! I do the EXACT same thing. I throw all the money in the air and whatever stays in the air God has chosen to use for the church and whatever hits the ground is mine to keep.\"\n",

      "A Story of Two Bees So once upon a time, there were two bees, and they were out collecting pollen for their hive. It was going well at first, but soon the clouds started to gather together. One bee said to Two bee, \"We better hurry up and meet our quota, it looks like it's going to rain.\" Two bee said to One bee, \"Yes, I agree. Our colony is in grave danger of starvation, and we need to bring them this pollen.\" But soon, the rain began. The bees headed for shelter, but before long, One Bee was hit by a drop of water. Two Bee rushed to his side, and dragged him under a leaf, but it was too late. As One Bee lay dying, he said \"Two Bee, you must live. Take the pollen I have gathered, the hive needs it. And when you return, tell my wife and children, I love them. Go on without me,\" then died. As the rain cleared up, Two Bee knew he still had a long journey ahead of him, so he set his emotions aside. What happened next? Two Bee Continued.\n",

She meets St. Peter at the pearly gates and is adorned with a halo. \"Come on this way,\" St. Peter says, \"I'll give you the tour.\" Mother Teresa is taken aback by the beauty of the angels, clouds and fountains. The pair come across a beautiful Princess Diana, who has a very large ring around her head. \"Why does she have a bigger halo than I do?\" Mother Teresa asks in disbelief. \"Don't worry about it. Come on, I'll show you the rest of the tour,\" St. Peter says. Mother Teresa starts tugging at St. Peter's robe, proclaiming \"Why does that bitch have a bigger halo than I do?\" Again, St. Peter tries to move on, \"Look, just drop it, it's not important.\" Mother Teresa then starts violently shaking St. Peter's shoulders and yells \"WHY IN THE WORLD DOES THAT FUCKING WHORE HAVE A BIGGER HALO THAN I DO?!?!??!?\" St. Peter kneels over to Mother Teresa and whispers in her ear. \"It's not a halo, it's a steering wheel.\"\n",
